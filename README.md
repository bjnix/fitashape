#Fit-A-Shape


This is a game intended to be used with a display wall and vicon tracking system 

This version is meant to be run on the IVS (Immersive Virtual System) wall at Michigan Technological University and may not (read _won't_) work on whatever else you might want to run it on.

###Testing Fit-A-Shape
Right now, local testing is limited, but check back later for more complete instructions as we will try to make it easier once it is working better on the IVS
